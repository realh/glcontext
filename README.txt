GLContext
---------

This is glcontext, a cross-platform library with a unified API for setting up an
OpenGL or OpenGL ES context. It currently supports MS Windows, Linux (and other
Unixes with GLX or EGL), including on Raspberry Pi, and Android (not properly
tested yet). I hope to add Mac and iOS support one day.

All files are distributed under a BSD license, see COPYING.txt for details.

The project's home page is <http://code.google.com/p/glcontext> where more
documentation is available in the Wiki.
